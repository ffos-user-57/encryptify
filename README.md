# Encryptify
Encryptify is a website that teaches about encryption + There is no database, nor does it store your information  in any way- it can convert your password to md5 and sha1.  

# Installation
Get XAMPP (with php 8 or higher ) - run apache on it - open your htdocs and dump the encryptify folder inside - Done.

# Difficulties/Errors
If you are facing difficulties its most likely cause of an outdated version of PHP (I used PHP 8.0.11) or XAMPP (I used v3.3.0) (Tho most versions should work, older ones might not - also if you are not using XAMPP you are gonna have to figure out how to set it all up - no external modules/libraries are required)

If you are getting any other kind of error submit it here on Github so I'll look into it.
